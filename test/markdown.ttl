FALSE supports all the features of standard Markdown,
but links and embeds are more powerful than standard Markdown.
Download the source file to see how things are done.

## Linking to things

You can link to any document using its ID: here is one about [templates](jinja)

URLs are relative to the base ID supplied to the build process, so you can easily link to the documents you've defined.
(Absolute URLs are ok, but note that any prefixes defined in the TTL aren't accessible to markdown.)

When linking to a document, if you don't supply link text, FALSE will use the document's title.

The document gets a "links to" relationship which you can use in [templates][1].

[Links to external Web resources](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) still work in the normal way.

If you use the link syntax for something that's not a document, you get a ["mentions"][2] relationship.

## Embedding content

Embeds use the syntax of images in Markdown, but extend it.
If you've defined an image as a Content (or a sub-type, like Picture), then you can embed it by its ID like this

![](lingshed)

The embedded image is automatically rendered in a nice way, with a link leading to its own page.
And because the image has a caption defined, and a description for the alt-text, there is no need to supply these every time you embed it.

This isn't limited to images: any document can be embedded, including other documents written in Markdown.
(Use templates and CSS to determine whether users know that something was embedded, or not.)

![](reusable)

You can't embed something that isn't a Content, only link to it.

If you just want to embed an image from the internet, you can still do that, but you don't get <s>a cookie</s> the extra features.

### Teasers

<false-content context="http://id.colourcountry.net/false/teaser" src="http://id.colourcountry.net/world/India">
<false-content context="http://id.colourcountry.net/false/teaser" src="mentions">

Teasers are a fancy way to link to another entity. You can link to anything, it doesn't have to be Content.

The special `<false-content>` HTML tag provides access to these,
assuming you have defined an [appropriate template][1].

### Advanced embedding

Regular embeds can also be specified with `<false-content>` though I am not sure why you'd want to.

<false-content context="http://id.colourcountry.net/false/embed" src="lingshed"></false-content>

In future FALSE may allow you to define your own contexts and refer to them in this way.

# FALSE will stitch plain Markdown files to entities, as well as images. Here it'll get the content from `reusable.md`

# But personally I prefer to keep the Markdown with the rest of the entity and define it in the Turtle file.
