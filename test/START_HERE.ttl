# Let's make a Web site with FALSE!

# First, some housekeeping. These next three lines will begin pretty much every file.

            # I'll be using a lot of the stuff FALSE has defined for us, so I'll declare a prefix first.
            @prefix : <http://id.colourcountry.net/false/> .
            # This means that when you see an ID like :Site, it refers to something defined by FALSE,
            # in this case <http://www.colourcountry.net/false/model/Site>

            # I will also be using SKOS quite a bit.
            # SKOS defines simple things like labels, notes on concepts, and relations between them.
            @prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .

            # In addition I'll grab XSD for its dateTime type, which FALSE uses.
            @prefix xsd:   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

# I can start defining things now.

<site> a :Site .
# This statement defines a Web site with ID <site>.
# URLs always go in angle brackets.
# FALSE interprets URLs relative to a base URL defined in run_me.sh. Use relative URLs for entities you're going to define yourself.

# Give the web site a name.
<site> skos:prefLabel "FALSE demo site"@en .

# And some content for the front page. Multi-line content goes in triple quotes.
# False uses Markdown as the syntax for normal text.
<site> :markdown """
This web site demonstrates as many features of FALSE as I could fit in.

# ![](whatisfalse) is an embedded document which I need to define.
# Here's a more condensed way to define a document.
# The difference is, instead of repeating the ID like `<site>` above, we can string statements together with `;`

# What is FALSE

FALSE is a Fully Automated <s>Luxury</s> Lightweight Semantic Engine.

It's a static web site generator powered by RDF and IPFS, with a dash of [Markdown][1] and a sprinkle of [Jinja][2].

# The `;` syntax is part of Turtle, the Terse Triple Language, which is what this file uses.

# FALSE will pull together all the Turtle files it can find to build the web site.
# The document <markdown> referenced just now can be found in the file `markdown.ttl`
