# Let's make a Web site with FALSE!

# I'll be using a lot of the stuff FALSE has defined for us, so I'll declare a prefix first.
@prefix : <http://id.colourcountry.net/false/> .
# This means that when you see an ID like :Site, it refers to something defined by FALSE,
# in this case <http://www.colourcountry.net/false/model/Site>

# I will also be using SKOS quite a bit.
# SKOS defines simple things like labels, notes on concepts, and relations between them.
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .
# In addition I'll grab XSD for its dateTime type, which FALSE uses.
@prefix xsd:   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

# We can start defining things now.

<Site> a :Site .
# This statement defines a Web site with ID <Site>.
# URLs always go in angle brackets.
# FALSE interprets URLs relative to a base URL defined in run_me.sh. Use relative URLs for entities you're going to define yourself.

# Give the web site a name.

FALSE supports all the features of standard Markdown,
but links and embeds are more powerful than standard Markdown.

## Linking to things

You can link to any document using its ID: here is one about [](contexts)
URLs are relative to the base ID supplied to the build process, so you can easily link to the documents you've defined.
(Absolute URLs are ok, but note that any prefixes defined in the TTL aren't accessible to markdown.)

When linking to a document, if you don't supply link text, FALSE will use the document's title.

[Links to external Web resources](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) still work in the normal way.

## Embedding content

Embeds use the syntax of images in Markdown, but extend it.
If you've defined an image as a Content (or a sub-type, like Picture), then you can embed it by its ID like this

![](lingshed)

Notice that the embedded image is automatically rendered in a nice way, with a link leading to its own page.
And because the image has a description defined, there is no need to supply alt-text when you embed it.

This isn't limited to images: any document can be embedded, including other documents written in Markdown.

![](reusable)

You can't embed something that isn't a document, only link to it.

If you just want to embed an image from the internet, you can still do that, but you don't get <s>a cookie</s> the extra features.

A rendition is a representation of a document,
for example as a media file.

You are reading a rendition of this document
sourced from inline markdown in the TTL.

FALSE will look for additional renditions
in files in the same directory that match the ID.

This document's ID is `renditions` so FALSE will
look for files beginning `renditions`:

  * `renditions.md`
  * `renditions.html`
  * `renditions.mp4`
  * `renditions.svg`

and so on.

Templates can access these using `{{ rendition }}`.

FALSE will choose the rendition most suitable for presenting on a Web site
and generate HTML code for it that can be included using `{{ html }}`.
