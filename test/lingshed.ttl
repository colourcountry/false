I took [this photo][1] when I went to [India][2] in [2018][3].
It was a great trip!

In the paragraph above, the link syntax tells FALSE that this document mentions India.
The ID in the "link" refers to India itself (in my ID scheme), not a document about it.

Provided FALSE has built a page for the mentioned entity, it will render the mention as a full hyperlink
with a `rel` attribute specifying that it's a mention.

If FALSE hasn't built a page for the mentioned entity, because there isn't a template for its type,
then it will mark the mention up with HTML5's [`data` tag][4] instead, in case you want to do something with it in scripts or CSS.

If FALSE knows the URL is a Web resource (like [][5]), or it doesn't recognize the linked URL at all,
it produces a standard link.
