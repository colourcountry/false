        <p>
            A rendition is a representation of a document,
            for example as a media file.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are reading a rendition of this document
            sourced from <code>renditions.html</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            FALSE will look for additional renditions
            in other files in the same directory that match the ID,
            and in the inline markdown in the TTL.
        </p>
        <!--
            ( If you can see this paragraph, the file
            has been rendered as source.

            This is probably because FALSE doesn't put
            file extensions on media files, and your
            browser hasn't realized it's HTML. )
