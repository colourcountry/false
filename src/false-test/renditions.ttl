"""
A rendition is a representation of a document,
for example as a media file.

You are reading a rendition of this document
sourced from inline markdown in the TTL.

FALSE will look for additional renditions
in files in the same directory that match the ID.

This document's ID is `renditions` so FALSE will
look for files beginning `renditions`:

  * `renditions.md`
  * `renditions.html`
  * `renditions.mp4`
  * `renditions.svg`

and so on.

Templates can access these using `{{ rendition }}`.

## Renditions and contexts

FALSE defines four contexts: `page`, `embed`, `teaser` and `download`.
Often, a different rendition is suitable for different contexts, for example thumbnails of different sizes.

## Renditions and privacy

You might want to publish cut-down renditions, but keep the original files for yourself. Entities like this are termed [restricted](false-test/restricted)

![](false-test/restricted)

You can also specify that an entity is [private](false-test/private), in which case it will not be published and no renditions will be available.
